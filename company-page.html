        <h3>How It All Started</h3>
          
        <p>While studying at the University of Victoria in 2006, Co-founder Heikal Gani bought his first suit. Unfortunately, he didn't get what he was looking for. Heikal had diligently searched for the right attire in local department stores and online but couldn’t find anything that would fit or that he could afford. Eventually he had to settle for a generic, off-the-rack garment that required extensive and expensive tailoring. 
        <P>Heikal believed that there must be a better way for men to select and buy this essential component of their wardrobe. So he got together with best friend and classmate, Kyle Vucko, to discuss finding a solution to a problem that many men still face today. They agreed that custom made designer suits look and feel fantastic. However, the industry's outdated fitting process was inconvenient and the cost—well, let's not go there.</p>
        <P>for a company that would craft stylish, custom made suits matching every man's unique size profile. They would be ordered online, delivered anywhere in the world—and take the strain off our wallets. In 2007, Indochino was born. Today, Indochino has grown to over 100 employees based in Vancouver, Canada and Shanghai, China. We have created beautifully customized apparel for thousands of men in 130 countries around the world. Our goal is to help men dress in stylish, custom fit suits and apparel at prices they can afford and in doing so shape a new and improved world of custom men's fashion.</p>
